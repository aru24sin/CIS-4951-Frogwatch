He wants expert volunteers to be able to access it

He wants it to be more of a tool for expert opinions on different frog sightings

Wants a research paper

It will be on the FOR website for them to be able to access

Preferred android, maybe apple?

Do it on a central server on campus for the AI computation (SSH into campus resources for training)

More user perception on federated learning to see what users think about federated learning on technical
and social aspects (explore in the research)
    - Wants to know why it isn't used in the field

Overall goal: train, report, and collect data

LACK OF DATA FOR FROG AUDIO
    - Sound ID is common but has not been touched on in this field
    - Adapt other audio sound ID libraries

Biggest challenges:
    - User perception
    - Lack of data
    - Publishing the app

Use cases:
    - Users collect data and label the data

Edge case:
    - Users inputting the wrong data

Users will run the model on their phone (AI computation happens on the phone)

A really open project with a lot of details that can be changed ***
